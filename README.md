Racing Simulation for TTRPGs (Early Development Build)
Note: This project is in its early development stage and is primarily intended for use in custom tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). It is not a professional simulation tool and may not accurately reflect real-world racing dynamics.

This project is a Python-based racing simulation game designed to facilitate custom tabletop role-playing game scenarios involving races between drivers and teams on various tracks.

Features
Basic Race Simulation: Simulate races between drivers and teams on different tracks.
Initial Lap Time Calculation: Preliminary lap time calculation based on simplified models.
Customizable Data: Easily customize drivers, teams, cars, and track data using JSON files.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/racing-simulation.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd racing-simulation
Run the main script to start the simulation:
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate through the simulation.

Customization
Data Files
drivers.json: Contains information about drivers including their skills and teams.
teams.json: Defines the teams participating in the races along with their cars.
cars.json: Specifies the attributes of the cars used by the teams.
tracks.json: Describes the tracks available for racing, including segment details.
Feel free to customize these files according to your preferences.

Known Issues and Improvements
Limited Simulation Features: The simulation aspect is basic and lacks realism.
Simplified Lap Time Calculation: Current lap time calculation methods may not accurately reflect real-world racing dynamics.
User Experience: User interface and experience may be lacking or unintuitive.
